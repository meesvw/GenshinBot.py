> Your small, fast and customizable Discord Genshin Impact bot

##  Roadmap
We are finally back in development ***Whoop whoop!*** I took a big break to really think about a way to make this bot work with less dependencies and setups.
I also really wanted to make this bot as customizable as possible. So I took out most of the annoying dependencies like mongodb and replaced them with Python native solutions.
For the time being you will still need aiohttp and requests, but I will most definitely port everything over to aiohttp so you will need even less dependencies.

### What this bot will do for you
- Out of the box Genshin Impact Discord RPG bot
- A system to automatically add/update the following:
  - travelers
  - enemies
  - items
  - events
- Callable classes (For example Traveler, Enemy, Item)

### Plans for the future (More will come)
- Wishing system
- PvE system
- PvP system
- Gather system (You will need to travel to actual locations for resources)
- Crafting system
- Trading system (trade your duplicated weapons or items with other players)
- Customizable quests for your server

### Currently working on
> Database function to gather and insert information about travelers, enemies and items.

## Requirements
- Discord bot token ([Guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html))

## Contribute
You can contribute to this project by using the bot, sharing this repo, reporting bugs and contributing code.
You can buy me a drink on [**Ko-fi**](https://ko-fi.com/meesvw), but is in no way necessary!
